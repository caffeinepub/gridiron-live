# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve the celebration overlay layout by making the score text smaller and positioning it below the celebration image.

**Planned changes:**
- Reduce font size of celebration score text in CelebrationOverlay component
- Reposition celebration text to appear below the team celebration image
- Ensure proper spacing between image and text
- Apply changes to both left and right team celebrations

**User-visible outcome:** When a team scores, the celebration overlay will display with smaller text positioned neatly below the team image instead of centered on screen.
