# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Reposition quarter timer and control buttons in the broadcaster interface for better layout organization.

**Planned changes:**
- Move quarter control buttons (Start, Pause, Reset, Next Quarter) to the same position as the point section controls
- Reposition the quarter timer display to overlay at the top-left corner of the camera video feed

**User-visible outcome:** The quarter timer appears at the top-left of the video feed, and the quarter control buttons are grouped with the point tracking controls for easier access during broadcasts.
