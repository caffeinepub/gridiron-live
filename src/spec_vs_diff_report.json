  "summary": "The diff fully implements REQ-1. The CelebrationOverlay component has been modified to display celebration text below the image with reduced font size. The layout uses flexbox with vertical stacking (flex-col), positioning text directly below the image with gap-2 spacing. Font size is reduced from what was likely larger centered text to text-lg/text-xl (smaller responsive sizing). Changes apply to the component uniformly regardless of team side.",
