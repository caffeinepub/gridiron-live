  "architectural_notes": [
    "Add a 'single-broadcaster' rule: only the owner can create/start the live session; viewers are view-only.",
    "Support a fixed session code ('pinedo') for the primary broadcast flow (no code generation needed for this mode).",
    "Render scoreboard UI as an overlay on the video element/stream (bottom of camera) for both broadcaster preview and viewer playback; remove the separate bottom-of-screen scorebar UI.",
    "Flag events should render as a temporary on-video overlay (team + reason) visible to both broadcaster and viewers.",
    "Score updates should be set via manual entry controls (no +1 point button) and persisted so viewers see updates.",
    "Scoreboard overlay: reduce overlay height (smaller vertical footprint) while keeping it on-video for both broadcaster and viewer.",
    "Flag overlay: show the entered reason; position the overlay on the selected team’s side (left/right); auto-hide after 3 seconds.",
    "Scoreboard overlay should display a one-word team name mapped from the selected icon: fist→Titans, tornado→Twisters, bullfrog→Bullfrogs, dolphin→Dolphins.",
    "Score editing controls: keep manual score entry AND add +/− adjustment buttons in the same broadcaster score edit panel.",
    "Add an offense indicator arrow to the scoreboard overlay; broadcaster can toggle which team is on offense from the score edit panel and viewers see updates in real time."

    "Flag overlay is not auto-dismissing (currently lasts indefinitely) despite intended 3-second timeout.",

    "Viewers see a black screen (video not rendering/received) when broadcaster is live.",
    "Subtitles are being generated from the viewer’s own microphone instead of the broadcaster’s mic audio."
